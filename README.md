# CPU / Disk Scheduler Simulator

This document will serve as our documentation for our alternative assessment at ICS26012 Operating System course.
This repository contains the assigned algorithms to us:

- Priority (Non-preemptive)
- Multilevel Queue System
- Shortest Seek Time First

## The Algorithms

This section of the document explains the algorithms that we have implemented
in the project. One preemptive, one non-preemptive, and one disk scheduler

## User Manual

For convenienceâ€™s sake, this repository is hosted online on netlify
without needing to install dependencies and hosting locally.
You can easily access the website by going into this link: https://cpu-disk-scheduler.netlify.app/

### Manual Install
To run the project locally on the device, you must have the following requirements:
- Git
- NodeJS
- NPM

To start, run the following commands in your terminal (without the $)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/glitchcodes/cpu-disk-scheduling.git
$ cd cpu-disk-scheduling
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
After running `npm run dev`, the terminal should display a link that will
allow you to visit the website.
